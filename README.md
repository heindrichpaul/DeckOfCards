## Reason for the project

I wanted to write a library for a deck that I could use for multiple card games. I have looked at other projects but found that it was not meeting all my requirements. I also decided I wanted to use this project as an excercise for Golang modulization.

## Project status

The base implementation is complete but I will add more functionality if needed.

## Install

With a [correctly configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing) Go toolchain:

```sh
go get -u github.com/heindrichpaul/deckofcards
```

## License

MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details.
